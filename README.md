# Daily Jokes
---
A simple joke generator.

In the program, there is a simple UI for the program(I promise it will look better) with lots of funny jokes.

The goal of this project is to familiarize with API, and how working with server (Node js) is like. 

Feel free to explore the code and play with it.

You can:
- select a theme
- black list NSFW, politics, racism, etc.
- choose whether to have the word 'cat' in the joke
- generate a JOKE !!

## If you're interested in trying it out, you will need:
- [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Probably Visual Studio Code or any Code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com)

## To Run
1. move to the project folder by writing 'cd 'path/to/your/project/folder' (you can get the path by dragging it to the terminal as well)
2. Through the terminal, install all modules for Node js using 'npm i' or 'npm install'
3. Type 'nodemon index.js' in the terminal (in case it doesn't work, nodemon is probably missing but you can easily install nodemon as well)
